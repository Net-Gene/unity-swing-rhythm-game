# Ryhm√§ 4 - Syysprojekti

## Project Name

Unity Swing Rhythm Game

## Description

This project is a Unity game that involves a unique controller with an accelerometer, an ESP32, and buttons to change lanes. The controller is connected to the game via Bluetooth and utilizes the accelerometer for gameplay. The game features a "Guitar Hero" style rhythm where you select from three lanes and swing the controller when a log crosses the red bar. Be careful to avoid hitting fish, otters, and beavers, as they result in negative points. Additionally, there's a special red line inside the red bar, and timing your swing when a wooden log crosses it grants double points.

## Installation

git clone https://peke.plab.fi/dboussak/ryhmae-4-syysprojekti.git


- Run the game in Unity by opening the project in Unity.
