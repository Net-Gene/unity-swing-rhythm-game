# Unity Rhythm Game ðŸªµðŸª“

## Overview  
This project was completed as part of a Unity game development course. The goal was to create a simple rhythm game emphasizing timing and coordination.

## Project Details  
A two-person team developed a Unity rhythm game where players swipe to hit wooden blocks while avoiding obstacles. The gameplay uses three lanes and features an axe mechanic to chop wood in rhythm.

With a tight 2-month deadline, the game was successfully completed.  
We also created a game trailer, which you can watch here: [PeliTrailer.mov](./PeliTrailer.mov)
